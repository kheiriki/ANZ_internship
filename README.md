# ANZ_internship

#Project:
Exploratory data analysis and prediction of annual salary for customers from the dataset provided by ANZ.

#Dataset Description:
The Dataset that was given to us is based on a synthesised transaction dataset containing 3 months’ worth of transactions for 100 hypothetical customers. It contains purchases, recurring transactions, and salary transactions.

The dataset is designed to simulate realistic transaction behaviours that are observed in ANZ’s real transaction data, so many of the insights we will gather will be genuine

#Tasks:
Task 1: Segmenting the dataset and drawing unique insights, including visualisation of the transaction volume and assessing the effect of any outliers.

Task 2: Exploring correlations between customer attributes, building a regression and a decision-tree prediction model based on your findings.
